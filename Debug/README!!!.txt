There is NO way you can register as an admin, we made it that way without realizing the consequences.

The only way you want to make an admin user is change the user type from "false" to "true" or,
make a new line, with format from the documentation. the encrypt keyword is 'gandhi', each password letter index (from 0)
add it's ascii based on the keyword alphabet order (i.e. for your 2nd letter index, add it by one, a = 1 in alphabetic
order). If your password surpass the keyword, start it again at the word that surpassed it.

there is a default admin,

username : admin
password : admin

that's all, thanks!
